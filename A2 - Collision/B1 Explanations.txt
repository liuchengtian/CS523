PartC:

The diffrence of the outputs between PartA and PartB is that all polygons in PartA are convex and all polygons in Part B are concave. 

The output of PartB is incorrect with Standard GJK (should be no collision).

A new fixed polygons2 file named polygons2fixedfinal.xml solves this problem by changing all polygons in PartB to convex (with correct output of no collision).


PartD:

PartD also has the same incorrect output as PartB (should be no collision).

Convex polygonal decomposition should be used to solve thiss problem without changing xml input.
