PartC:

The diffrence of the outputs between PartA and PartB is that all polygons in PartA are convex and all polygons in Part B are concave. 

The output of PartB is incorrect with Standard GJK (should be no collision) because all polygons in Part B are concave.

A new fixed polygons2 file named polygons2fixedfinal.xml solves this problem by changing all polygons in PartB to convex (with correct output of no collision).

In this file we also rearranged the sequence of vertices of polygons to be plotted to output the right shapes of polygons.


PartD:

PartD also has the same incorrect output as PartB (should be no collision).

Convex polygonal decomposition should be used to solve thiss problem without changing xml input.
